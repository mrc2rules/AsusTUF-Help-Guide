Welcome to the ASUS TUF community. Congratulations on your new device! This guide will help you get started.&#x20;

## ðŸª„ The Essentials

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Inspect for damage

Make sure it's free of any physical defects or screen issues like dead pixels. It's rare, but a good idea to be careful!
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Update Windows

After completing the initial setup, update your operating system. Go to _Settings_ > _Update & Security_ > _Windows Update_ and click _Check for updates_. This ensures you have the latest features and security patches.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Update NVIDIA and AMD Drivers

Open the '[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/)' and '[AMD Adrenalin](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin.html)' app to update your graphics drivers. This is crucial for optimal performance.&#x20;

Avoid updating graphics drivers from Windows Update/MyAsus as they can be pretty old.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Register your device

Use the MyAsus app or [https://account.asus.com/](https://account.asus.com/) and register your laptop's serial key for warranty support
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## ðŸ’» The Next Steps

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Uninstall bloat software

Delete apps you don't need, **including pre-installed antivirus like** **McAfee, Norton** etc. They create unnecessary overhead and slow down your PC.

Windows Defender is there by default and enough to protect your PC.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Install GHelper (Recommended but optional)

GHelper is an open-source, minimalistic and lightweight alternative to Armoury Crate for managing performance, fan curves, power settings and more, on your TUF laptop.&#x20;

Unlike AC, which is buggy, bloated and RAM-heavy, GHelper runs in the background with minimal impact on system performance. It has **all** the features BUT without unnecessary extras - and with a much cleaner UI.
