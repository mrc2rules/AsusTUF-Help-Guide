# Cleaning Your Laptop

Laptops are often exposed to dust, hair, and other particles which can block cooling vents and ports of your laptop. This can lead to decreased system performance, and even at times shorten the hardware’s lifetime. We recommend that you regularly clean your laptop to ensure its longevity.

## **Cleaning the LCD screen**

When cleaning the stains/fingerprints/dust from the display’s surface, please use a soft microfiber cleaning cloth dampened with 70 to 75% isopropyl alcohol or other LCD cleaning solutions, and wipe the screen **gently**. Ensure the cloth is damp and not soaking.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: **Do not spray any cleaning solutions directly onto the screen surface or leave any liquid on the screen when finishing.**
{% endhint %}

1. Spray isopropyl alcohol or LCD cleaning solution on the soft cloth to achieve **slight** dampness. Should the alcohol or cleaning solution drip from the cloth, please squeeze excess liquid before proceeding. Gently wipe the screen clean of any dirt or smudges.\
   \
   Water can also be used when other solutions are unavailable.
2. Let the LCD screen dry completely after cleaning the screen before closing the lid.\
   If there are still marks or steaking, gently wipe the surface with a dry cloth moving from the top of LCD panel to the bottom.
